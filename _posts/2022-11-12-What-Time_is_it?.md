All results presented herein are directly taken from the paper "What time is it? Deep learning approaches for circadian rhythms" by Agostinelli et al. published in Bioinformatics, 32, 2016.
	
## Motivation:
Circadian rhythms (CRs) play a crucial role in our everyday life - literally! The word circadian is directly derived from "approximately daily" and CRs therefore are a class of biochemical oscillaors with a period of approximately 24 hours. CRs can be found in animals, plants and funghi, all three kingdoms of life on earth.
Fundamentally, CRs (and many other periodic changes) are encoded by oscillating concentrations of specific molecular species like for example proteins. 
Fortunately, modern measurement technologies are capable of extractring ever more detailed data from biochemical systems, thereby reveiling rhytmic behaviour andother complex patterns. Still, measurements are expensive and corupted by noise, meking it non-trivial to conclude reliable findings. 
The paper therefore poses two questions of interest that are answered in the course of the article:

* Is a biochemical species of interest periodically osciallting?
* Can we extrapolate periodic behaviour reliably from scarse data?
